Above is a picture of Racket, our [Javan Rhinocerous](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/javan-rhino) who is the main character or our game.
## Why a Javan Rhinocerous?
We chose to make the main character a Javan Rhinocerous for two reasons:
1. This is an endangered species and it would bring awareness
1. The name has the word "Java" in it
## Why Racket?
Well, CS students and Racket are clearly common enemies. Also there is nice alliteration.
